# IRCC-Spousal-Online-Form-Signature
A Guide to place digital signature on online IRCC forms


Pro tip :  (Applies to Online Application) - Working

Instead of to and fro emailing, and printing, there is a method that i discovered, and used in my sponsorship application too, and it works. 

Step 1 :
- Both the PA and Sponsor, each should sign on a separate piece of white paper, preferably with Black Ink.
- Scan the signatures with Camscanner or any other scanner app, or a conventional scanner.
- Save the scanned image as a jpg
- Now, go to remove.bg website and upload the scanned signatures, this will remove the white background, and gives you a transparent signature.
- Save the signature as a png image (as this preserves the transparency).

Step 2 :
- Fill the application forms IMM1344, IMM5532 and IMM5476, validate them wherever there is a validation, fill up the date etc.
- Verify that the application forms are completely filled, only signature field is remaining.
- Now, print the form, and in the printer options, select save to PDF.
- Now, go to https://www.sejda.com/pdf-editor and upload the saved PDF file, and your filled form should load correctly.
- Go to Sign --> New Signature --> Upload Signature. Upload the transparent signature for Sponsor and PA.
- Now click on the signature and drag and drop on the signature line, and you should be good.
- Save the PDF, download it, and you are done.

I will do a video demo soon for further clarification.
